# Multi-layered perceptron from scratch

This is a multi-layered perceptron made from scratch in pure Python, without any Machine Learning libraries. Libraries are only used for analysis/plotting.
This project was done in December 2021 as a project for the Machine Learning course 2IIG0 of the Computer Science and Engineering Bachelor of Technische Universiteit Eindhoven. It was submitted on 23rd of December 2021. You can find the code and the corresponding report. The code was all written by myself.
